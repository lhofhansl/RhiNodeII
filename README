This is version w of RhiNode, a Javascript API around Java's NIO library.

The API is heavily inspired by node.js. Where feasible and
sensible the API is compatible to node.js.

Common.js type modules are used to encapulate functionality.

Currently basic Net, Http, and Timer modules are implemented; FileSystem
comming soon.

The Net and Timer modules are written in Java with a thin Javascript layer
and are *very* efficient (~2x node.js).

The Http module is (currently) unchanged from my first version of RhiNode
and writen entirely in Javascript.

This is version 0.2, it works pretty for me and performs pretty well.
But there are a bunch of hacks and shortcuts that need to be addressed.

For integration with Rhino a bunch of files where copied from the Rhino
distribution and slightly modified. The changed are packaged in a separate
jar and can used with standard Rhino installation.
You need the latest Rhino 1.7r3, though (a pristine jar is included).

To get started:
#build/install
ant -Ddist=<installDir>
#run a simple http server
<installDir>/rhinode example/http-1.1-content-length.js
